## ðŸš€ @qavajs
The **qavajs** is a modular test automation framework designed to minimize setup time and streamline the development of test scripts.
It is mainly achieved due to the built-in page object engine and ready-to-use sets of domain-agnostic BDD step definitions suitable for both API and UI testing of the web and native mobile applications.
